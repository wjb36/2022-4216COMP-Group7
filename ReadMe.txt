Joshua's Instructions:
1. To use my visualisation you can click SHIFT+F5 on your keyboard to start the application
2. Once it has begun running, the program will prompt for the user to select if they want to use all of the records or not
3. To do this the user must enter either a CAPITAL Y or N, anything else will not work
4. The program will then ask for a start date, this will NEED to be in this specific format D-MMM-YY
5. The program will then ask for a end date, this will NEED to be in this specific format D-MMM-YY
6. This will prompt the program to produce a graph with the corresponding records that have been chosen at the start
